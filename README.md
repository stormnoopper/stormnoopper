# Hi, I'm Naenon! 👋


## 🚀 About Me
My dream job would be as a Full-Stack developer. Since I was ten years old, I have been researching a lot of computer skills such as building Lego - Mindstorms and solar-cell robots. In high school, I enjoy working on projects especially web development so I think I am really into it.
